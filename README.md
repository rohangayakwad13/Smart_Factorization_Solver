🧮 Included Formulas
No.	Formula Name	Formula
1	Square of Binomial (a + b)	(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
2	Square of Binomial (a − b)	(a − b)² = a² − 2ab + b²
3	Cube of Binomial (a + b)	(a + b)³ = a³ + b³ + 3ab(a + b)
4	Difference of Squares	a² − b² = (a − b)(a + b)
5	Sum of Cubes	a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² − ab + b²)
6	Difference of Cubes	a³ − b³ = (a − b)(a² + ab + b²)
🖥️ How to Use

Run the app using:

streamlit run app.py


Enter values for a and b

Click any button to calculate the selected formula

The answer will appear instantly with a green success box
